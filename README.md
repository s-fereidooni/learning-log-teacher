## Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (version 3.5.0 or higher recommended)
- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart) (comes with Flutter)
- [Firebase account](https://firebase.google.com/)
- Platform-specific tools:
  - Android: Android Studio, Android SDK
  - iOS/macOS: Xcode
  - Windows: Visual Studio with Desktop development tools
  - Linux: GTK3 development libraries

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd learning_log_teacher
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```sh
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Firebase Setup

#### a. Create a Firebase Project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2. Add apps for each platform you want to support (iOS, Android, Web, etc.).

#### b. Firestore Database Structure

To manage weekly questions, this app expects your Firestore database to have the following structure:

- **Collection:** `week_questions`
  - **Document:** `week1`, `week2`, ..., `week10` (one document per week)
    - **Subcollection:** `questions`
      - **Document:** (auto-generated ID for each question)
        - **Fields:** (add fields for each question, e.g., `text`, `options`, `answer`, etc.)

**Example:**

- `week_questions` (collection)
  - `week1` (document)
    - `questions` (subcollection)
      - `6sE685IThF3aYlec1hGG` (document)
        - `text`: "What is the capital of France?"
        - `answer`: "Paris"
      - `QL8aesrKY2GrxiaD8wD9` (document)
        - `text`: "What is 2 + 2?"
        - `answer`: "4"
  - `week2` (document)
    - `questions` (subcollection)
      - ...

**How to set up:**

1. In the [Firestore Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), create a collection named `week_questions`.
2. For each week, add a document (e.g., `week1`, `week2`, etc.).
3. Inside each week document, create a subcollection called `questions`.
4. Add a document for each question in the `questions` subcollection.  
   Each question document should contain fields such as `text`, `answer`, and any other data your app requires.

> **Tip:** The document IDs for questions can be auto-generated by Firestore.

Refer to the screenshot below for a visual example of this structure:

#### c. Configure Firebase for Each Platform

- **Android:**
  1. Download `google-services.json` from Firebase Console and place it in `android/app/`.
  2. Update `applicationId` in `android/app/build.gradle` to match your Firebase Android app.
- **iOS:**
  1. Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` and place it in `ios/Runner/`.
  2. Update `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` in Xcode to match your Firebase iOS app.
- **Web:**
  1. Copy your Firebase config from the Firebase Console.
  2. Update the `web` section in [`lib/firebase_options.dart`](lib/firebase_options.dart) with your config.
- **macOS/Windows/Linux:**
  1. Add your app in Firebase Console for each platform.
  2. Update [`lib/firebase_options.dart`](lib/firebase_options.dart) with the generated configs.

#### d. Update `lib/firebase_options.dart`

This file is generated by the [FlutterFire CLI](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/cli/).  
To regenerate it for your Firebase project:

```sh
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
flutterfire configure
```

Follow the prompts to select your Firebase project and platforms.

### 4. Platform-Specific Setup

#### Android

- Ensure your `applicationId` in `android/app/build.gradle` matches your Firebase project.
- Run:
  ```sh
  flutter run
  ```

#### iOS/macOS

- Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` or `macos/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
- Set the correct bundle identifier.
- Run:
  ```sh
  flutter run
  ```

#### Web

- Run:
  ```sh
  flutter run -d chrome
  ```

#### Windows/Linux

- Ensure you have the required desktop dependencies.
- Run:
  ```sh
  flutter run -d windows
  # or
  flutter run -d linux
  ```

## Project Structure

- `lib/` - Main Dart source code
  - `main.dart` - App entry point and routing
  - `analytics.dart` - Teacher analytics page
  - `week_selection_page.dart` - Week selection UI
  - `questions_management_page.dart` - Manage weekly questions
  - `firebase_options.dart` - Firebase configuration (generated)
- `android/`, `ios/`, `web/`, `macos/`, `windows/`, `linux/` - Platform-specific code and configs
- `pubspec.yaml` - Dependencies and assets

## Running Tests

```sh
flutter test
```

## Customization

- **App Name & Bundle IDs:**  
  Update in `pubspec.yaml` and platform-specific files (Xcode, AndroidManifest, etc.).
- **Icons & Branding:**  
  Replace assets in `assets/` and platform-specific icon folders.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter Firebase initialization errors, ensure `firebase_options.dart` is up to date and all platform configs are correct.
- For plugin issues, run `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get`.
